# LeicesterJS Speakers
Do you want to speak at the next LeicesterJS Meetup? File a new issue on this repo.

## What if I don't have a talk topic?
No problem! Just file an issue and tell us a bit about yourself and we can help you find a talk topic and prepare a talk around it.

## I'm nervous about speaking
It can be scary speaking. Public speaking is listed as one of the top fears for a lot of people! So you are not alone. But we can help! We can help you practise your delivery, fine tune your slides and help you give a great talk.

## How?
File an issue [here](https://github.com/leicesterjs/speakers/issues/new) with the template that is prefilled.

## Format
Usually we are looking for 2 talks for each meetup.
Each speaker is alloted around 20 minutes of time, but under or over that is fine

## Technical
We have a chrome cast, apple tv and screensharing available so you can present your talk slides.
Let us know if you require the use of a laptop to present your talk at the event and we can make this possible.

## After your talk
Please post links to your slides in the comments of your issue and any other links you would like to plug

## Questions?
Come and chat with us on Slack [here](https://bit.ly/leicesterjs-slack)
